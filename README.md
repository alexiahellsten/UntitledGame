# UntitledGame

I recently discovered that you can actually make some cool games with Javascript, so I thought why not expand my programming knowledge with trying to create my own tiny pixel RPG?

**Credit**
- The code I'm basing the game off is mainly from the amazing tutorial by [Game Dev Shift](https://gamedevshift.com/pizza-legends).
- Sprites, tile maps and assets are from a variety of resources (will update this later).
